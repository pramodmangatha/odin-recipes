    <h2>Description</h2>

    <P>Years ago I worked in a little coffee shop. We had a powdered cocoa mix with spices that was called Mexican Spiced Cocoa. On the can were directions for mixing it with espresso to get Mayan Mocha. I fell IN LOVE with that drink and have been searching for a replacement ever since. The coffee shop inside Hastings has a similar drink, but won't sell the mix to me for home use. So I researched a little, tested a little, and came up with this. To serve, stir 1/4 cup mix with 1 cup hot water and stir.</P>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>⅔ cup nonfat dry milk powder</li>
        <li>⅔ cup instant coffee granules</li>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>⅓ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons pumpkin pie spice</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground red pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Mix nonfat dry milk powder, instant coffee granules, sugar, cocoa powder, pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon, and ground red pepper in a bowl until thoroughly combined. </li>
        <li>Store in an airtight lidded container or a resealable plastic bag.</li>
        </ol>
